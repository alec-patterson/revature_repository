Planning notes:

In my opinion: People do both front-end and back-end

multiple people assigned to a user story

If possible try to derive other user stories from ones that are assigned.

Methodology for building the application
    Monolithic - should probably do
    Microservices - Would show off more what we learned and also help us gain experience on it.
